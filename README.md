# Area-Trapezium

This Python script calculates the **area of a trapezium** (also known as a trapezoid) based on user input for the lengths of the two parallel sides (base1 and base2) and the height.

## 📐 Formula Used

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
\]

Where:
- **Base₁**: First parallel side  
- **Base₂**: Second parallel side  
- **Height**: Perpendicular distance between the two bases
